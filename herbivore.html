      <p>
        Triceratops, one of the most iconic herbivorous dinosaurs, roamed the Earth during the late Cretaceous period. With its massive head equipped with a large bony frill and three imposing horns, it was well adapted for a life of grazing and foraging. Paleontologists believe that its horns served dual purposes: defense against predators and intraspecific combat during mating rituals or establishing hierarchy within herds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Extensive fossil records indicate that Triceratops likely moved in groups and may have used their horns to protect their young. Its robust jaw structure and specialized teeth allowed it to effectively process tough vegetation, making it one of the most successful herbivores of its era.

      <h2>Stegosaurus</h2>
      <img src="stegosaurus.jpg" alt="Stegosaurus">
      <p>
        Recognizable by its unique double row of bony plates along its back and the spiked tail—often referred to as a thagomizer—Stegosaurus lived during the Late Jurassic period. Its distinctive armor is thought to have served multiple functions, including defense, thermoregulation, and display for attracting mates. Despite its impressive size and heavy plating, Stegosaurus had a relatively small brain compared to its body size.
      </p>
      <p>
        Studies of its skeletal structure suggest that the plates may have helped regulate body temperature, while the tail spikes provided a formidable deterrent against predators. Stegosaurus remains one of the most studied dinosaurs due to its unusual appearance and the mysteries that still surround its behavior and lifestyle.
